 The Student Performance Predictor in Mathematics is a comprehensive tool that assesses and forecasts academic success based on three key components: lunch attendance, Internal Assessment 1 (IA1), and Internal Assessment 2 (IA2). It considers the regularity of a student's lunch attendance, recognizing its correlation with overall academic performance. IA1 evaluates the grasp of fundamental mathematical concepts, serving as a foundational indicator, while IA2 assesses the application of knowledge and problem-solving skills. By integrating these elements, the predictor provides educators with insights into a student's engagement, well-being, and academic capabilities. This holistic approach empowers institutions to implement targeted interventions and support systems, fostering a conducive learning environment for all students.
